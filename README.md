## Project Description: 
This app simplifies meal planning by allowing users to add and remove recipes and then itâ€™ll automatically update what ingredients they should buy. 

## List of main app features: 

### High Level features:
- Recipe library with some sorting features, such as certain ingredients or type of meal
- User can add, remove, and update recipes using a form
- Recipe must include a title, list of ingredients, and instructions. Optionally also includes an image, author, user rating 1-5, notes, categories (for sorting), and date field for when the user wants to cook it.
- User can select what recipes they want to cook. The app updates what ingredients need to be prepared and compiles a grocery list
- User can view the grocery list as a checklist when at store

### Additional features as feasible:
- User can add recipes using urls, which the app scrapes for the data and then fills in the form
- Kitchen inventory; app determines if ingredients in kitchen already and notifies user accordingly; Once recipe is prepared, app removes ingredients from inventory.
- Calendar view for weekly planning; ie days to cook, grocery shop, etc
